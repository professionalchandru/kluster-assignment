Thing to say to interviewr:
1. I can able to do even better design if I have a design wireframe
2. Here I have only implemented the add to cart functionality in books section because of the API's.
3. Here I took some open source api's that is not organaized in formal way and many data like author details, book and author description, images and so on are missing. Also API strucutre is being differed from api to api(like books to authors). So I can't implement the all functionality.
4. Some images might be not present beacuse of either api doesn't give the books img or img id.
5. Filtered by authors in books section doesn't clickable because we don't have enough information from the filter api.

Again I'm saying I can do a more better ui and functionality If I have a wireframe and correct backend apis and their structure.
